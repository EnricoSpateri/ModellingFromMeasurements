# ModellingFromMeasurements
Program for Modelling from measurements course

For DMD case study run setup in OPTDMD folder, then add the path and run.

For SINDy copy the code in python colab, uncomment the pip install packages and run.

For NNs is required the deep learning toolbox, add the path to its folder and run.

Reaction diffustion data file is too large and it must be reprocessed by running the .m script

The SINDy colab file output are just the coefficient for the 2nd order library. A script for the visualization must be added.

ENJOY!
